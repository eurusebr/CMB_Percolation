# CMB_Percolation
In this project, we determined the CMB Universality Class using the network science, finite-size scaling (FSS) hypothesis, percolation and extrem value theory on the full-sky map. Instead of performing a traditional FSS analysis at the critical phase transition point, we rather follow the universal framework of a FSS analysis recently developed based on the statistics and critical scaling of the size of the largest gap in the order parameter.
this project is based on a paper in Nature Physics: Universal gap scaling in percolation. Nat. Phys. 16, 495 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-0837-5
